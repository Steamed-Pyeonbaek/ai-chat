In the chat window, users can ask questions related to carbon emission reduction, and receive responses accordingly. The answers are generated using Solar LLM, which has been fine-tuned with Predibase.

## Future Development Directions

- Connect AI Chat Page to Dashboard Page
- DashBoard Data-Based Report Generation (PDF)
- Reflect dashboard data in LLM
- SBTi-based Target Emissions Recommendation and Setting System
- Automatically build inventory linked to open banking API
